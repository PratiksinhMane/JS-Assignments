Datatypes in JS:
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types.
1).The String Data Type
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.
Ex.1:var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
Ex.2:var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
2).The Number Data Type
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation.
Ex1:var a = 25;         // integer
Ex2:var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
Ex3:var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
Ex4:var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425.
3).The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false).
Ex1:var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
Ex2:var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping.
4).The Array Data Type
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
Ex1:var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
Ex2:var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 5).The Undefined Data Type
 The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
 Ex1:var a = null;
 alert(a); // Output: null
  
 var b = "Hello World!"
 alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
  
 b = null;
 alert(b) // Output: null.
